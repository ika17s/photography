      	 	 <p>"We love Alyssa! Choosing a photographer was<br> one of the biggest decisions I had while<br> planning my wedding, and choosing Alyssa was<br> the best decision.<br> 

You are with your photographer for hours<br>
 throughout your day so you want someone<br> who is keeping track of time and keeping you<br> on brand with the shots you want.<br> 

We met in person prior to my wedding to talk<br> about the shots I wanted and we just ended up<br> chatting like long lost best friends. She was so<br> calm my entire wedding day and made me feel<br> so comfortable.”</p>

      	 	<p>"For our second pregnancy announcement<br> we wanted to do a family photoshoot that<br> captured our excitement at the new life<br> coming, but also told the story of where<br> our family was at that precious moment in<br> time. Alyssa perfectly captured the love<br> between us, our joy, and told our story in<br> a way that I know will mean so much to<br> our family for years to come. I was so<br> grateful for her patience and positivity<br> throughout the shoot, and I can’t wait to<br> work with her again!”</p>
